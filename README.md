## Production Notes for Printing

1. Print the pictures using a photo printer (e.g. Canon Selphy)
   on 148x100mm photo paper.

2. Print A4 sheets of captions on A4 card paper (e.g. 160g/m²)
   using the manual feed of a laser printer, with printer
   settings set to 100% scale on A4 paper format with no margins.

3. Paste the photographs on A4 pages using double-sided tape, on the
   back of the corresponding captions. Four pictures are packed tight
   together on each page, starting from the top-left corner of the A4 page.

4. Cut around each photograph using scissors, then round the corners
   of the photographs pasted on card using a corner cutter of size Small.

5. Laminate sheets of 4 photographs,
   packed tight in an A4 laminating pouch.

6. Cut the laminated sheet around the edge of each photograph,
   which leaves the border all around the card exposed.

   *This is a compromise due to the constraints of the format:
   two pictures of length 148mm need to be set side by side with
   no gap in between to fit in the height of an A4 laminating pouch.
   Leaving an empty margin around each card would allow to place only
   two pictures in each A4 pouch instead of four.*
